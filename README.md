I found an [article](https://medium.com/beingprofessional/understanding-functor-and-monad-with-a-bag-of-peanuts-8fa702b3f69e) explaining functors and monads on an example of a grocery store with highly specialized workers. I am coding the described concepts in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/elixir), a functional programming language I am learning to extend my software development and computer science knowledge.
